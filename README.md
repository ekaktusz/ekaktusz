### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Csaba Ekart I'm a Software Engineer from Budapest, Hungary, currently working at Everbridge Inc. I'm experienced with C++, Python and Java. I'm interested in Game Development / Computer Graphics, Android development, Linux and Machine Learning. 

- ðŸŽ® Iâ€™m currently working on creating a simple platformer game with C++ and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), and exploring [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html).
- ðŸ“– At the moment I'm learning C++ on deeper levels and starting with Lua ( and pico 8) (We just finished on 4th place with our first game: [Elephant in The Room](https://zahkros.itch.io/elephant-in-the-room)).
- ðŸ’¡ Trying to create my own simple game engine, and tools for game development in general.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also interested in deepening my knowledge with Python, Rust, Go or Java. But I'm interested in any technology that is fun to use!
