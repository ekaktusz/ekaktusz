### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Csaba Ekart I'm a Software Engineer from Budapest, Hungary, currently working at Everbridge Inc. I'm experienced with C++, C#, Python and Java. I'm interested in Game Development / Computer Graphics, Backend development, Android development, Linux and Machine Learning. 

- ðŸŽ® Iâ€™m currently working on creating a simple game with C++ and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), and exploring [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html).
- ðŸ“– At the moment I'm learning C++ on deeper levels and starting with Lua (focusing on the *awesome* [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) framework and [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) the best fantasy console)
  - We just finished on 4th place with our first game on Game Off 2022: [Elephant in The Room](https://zahkros.itch.io/elephant-in-the-room)
  - Participated on Ludum Dare 52 with our game [Ursa Maior](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52/ursa-maior)
- ðŸ’¡ Trying to create my own simple game engine, and tools for game development in general (currently working on an SFML library that I use in my projects)
